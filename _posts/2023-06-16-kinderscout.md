Kinder Scout. One of the most enjoyable hike I ever hike comes with the most memorable journey of my life.

Core memory of hiking trip in the UK. I underestimated the duration of the route for a big group. Had to stay overnight at Edale stop as we missed the last train to Sheffield by 15 minutes. Summer ? Who cares, it's freezing at night !
