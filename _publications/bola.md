The KA272H monitor from Acer is an ideal day-to-day monitor for home or office use. The 27 Full HD (1920x1080) screen provides plenty of detail. You also get a 100Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time and AMD FreeSync support, which ensures that even the most high-speed action is smooth and blur-free. The KA272H features both HDMI & VGA ports, so you can easily connect it to a wide range of devices. Additionally, the stand features 20 of tilt adjustment, plus there's a 100x100 VESA mount so it can be used with a wide range of mounts or arms.

AMD FreeSync â€“ Allows the monitor's refresh rate to be controlled by a compatible graphics card, minimising tearing and other visual imperfections.
