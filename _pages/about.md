Welcome to Jimi's Digital Playground where I spend my days designing virtual coffee.

Think of this as my digital sketchbook, where I stash all the cool (and sometimes quirky) stuff I've been working on. Whether it's a project that made me pull an all-nighter (in a good way!), a random thought I couldn't shake, or just something I'm genuinely excited about, you'll probably find it here.

What's brewing? ☕
======
I'm currently obsessed with cheese and seaweed snacks.
When I'm not glued to a screen, you might find me:
- 🏞️ Getting lost on a hiking trail (with snacks, always).
- 🎮 Conquering virtual worlds (or at least trying to).
- 🃏 Practicing my cardistry and street card magic.

Stuff to let go
------
I'm graduating and going back to Malaysia this August so I got tons of beatiful items to let go. Feel free to browse thru the stuff and hit me up if you got your eyes on something. Take a peek [here](/publications/)! 👀
