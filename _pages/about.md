Welcome to my digital playground where I spend my days designing virtual coffee.

Think of this as my digital sketchbook, where I stash all the cool stuff I've been working on. Whether it's a project that made me pull an all-nighter, a random thought I couldn't shake, or just something I'm genuinely excited about, you'll probably find it here.

What's brewing? ☕
======
I'm currently obsessed with cheese and seaweed snacks.
When I'm not glued to a screen, you might find me:
- 🏞️ Getting lost on a hiking trail (with snacks, always).
- 🎮 Conquering virtual worlds (or at least trying to).
- 🃏 Practicing my cardistry and street card magic.

A New Site (and Ongoing Updates) ✨
------
 This site represents a migration from my older portfolio site, and I'm currently in the process of transferring and refining all my content here. While I'm working to get everything settled, you might notice some sections are still being populated. Please ignore :)
