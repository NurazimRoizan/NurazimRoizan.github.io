Researched and documented the CRYSTALS-Kyber (ML-KEM) algorithm, a lattice-based Post-Quantum Cryptography solution. The paper covers the quantum threat to current cryptography, the algorithmâ€™s operational mechanics, and its security profile as a NIST standard.

Project Overview
======
This research paper, completed for the COM3109 module, investigates the critical need for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) in the face of quantum computing's threat to current public-key encryption standards like RSA. The project focuses specifically on CRYSTALS-Kyber, a lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) selected as a standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

My work provides a comprehensive overview of the Kyber algorithm, from its foundational principles to its practical applications in securing future communications.

Key Research Areas
======
* The Quantum Threat: The paper establishes the motivation for PQC by explaining how Shor's algorithm can efficiently break classical cryptographic systems, highlighting the urgent need for new security standards.

* Algorithmic Breakdown: I detail the core components of the Kyber algorithm, including key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation. This involves explaining how it uses cryptographic hashing and pseudorandom functions to create a secure key exchange.

* Security Analysis: The research explores Kyber's security properties, focusing on the IND-CCA2 security notion it achieves. The paper discusses how its security is based on the computational hardness of the Module-LWE problem and the performance trade-offs of its various parameter sets (Kyber-512, -768, -1024).

What I Learned
======
Writing this paper was a valuable exercise in understanding the intricate details of modern cryptography and the future of cybersecurity. It provided a deep insight into the practical application of complex mathematical problems to secure data, as well as the rigorous process of standardization by organizations like NIST. The project reinforced my ability to research a highly technical subject, synthesize complex information, and present it clearly and logically.
